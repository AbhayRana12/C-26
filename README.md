# RedSaucePasta

1. Heat 1 tbsp  olive oil. Saute bell peppers or onions on a high flame just for 2 minute. You can also skip bell peppers and use onions. The taste would br different but good.
Set them aside to cool.

2. To the same pan, add ripe tomatoes and saute for 2 to 3 mins.

3. Tomatoes must turn soft. Add red chili flakes as needed. Set them aside to cool.

4. When colled add them to a blender jar.

5. Blend to a smooth or coarse paste. We prefer smooth. Set this aside.

6. While you mae the sauce, you can bring 2 litre water to a boil in a large pot. Add sault as needed.

7. When water comes to a boil and pasta. Cook all with following the instruction on the pack.

8. Drain off in a colander and rinse to remove extra starch.

9. Put back the same pan on the stove with another 1 tbsp oil. When hot saute garlic and red chili flakes until they turn fragrant.

10. Add chopped onions.

11. Saute until the raw smell goes away.

12. Add the pury and salt. Mix and cook on a medium heat until the sauce thickens.

13. This is the consistency i prefer, you can even take off a little earlier. Add oregano. Mix well. Off the slove.

14. Add the cooked pasta. I prefered another tbsp olive oil now. This is optional.

15. Saute until well combined.

16. Add crushed pepper. Serve pasta in red sauce hot.
